;; this file maps EMPLIDs to a random 10-byte hash, using a hash key
;; stored on the Cal Poly OneDrive. It appears that the chance of
;; a collision, for 100K students, is less than 4e-15.

;; note that cal poly can be a little inconsistent; Emplids are sometimes
;; treated as strings, and sometimes treated as integers, in which case
;; leading zeros may be trimmed, yikes. To fix this, we pad strings
;; shorter than the expected value to 9 digits.

;; the goal here is to use actual student records to predict
;; how many sections of each class are required.

;; the basic idea is to take each student, and count their
;; unmet requirements to determine how many quarters from
;; graduation they are, then to use the flow chart and
;; remove the classes they've already taken to determine
;; which classes they'll need in the next year.

;; this is the "per-student" model

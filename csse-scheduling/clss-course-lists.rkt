;; this short file parses the CSV files exported by CLSS, and should accurately
;; indicate which courses are to be staffed and scheduled by each of the three
;; departments (csse, cpe, ee) that I download spreadsheets for.

;; ugh. Even with "show courses with no sections", the exported CSV doesn't include
;; these courses.

;; this code is not currently used e.g. in check-schedule.rkt etc., but it probably
;; should be. (2022-07-21)

;; to update:
;; - go to clss
;; - double-click on the department
;; - choose export
;; - check the "show courses with no sections" box
;; - include the columns "Term Code" and "Course"
;; - move the files ... well, here, for the moment.
;; - adjust (or generalize) the course
